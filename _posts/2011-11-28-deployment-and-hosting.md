## Deploy Jekyll to GitHub Pages

You can deploy Jekyll to your GitHub account and GitHub will parse your repo through Jekyll and host the result on username.github.com
This is very nice of GitHub and the most convenient strategy.
However you cannot extend jekyll via plugins with this version because GitHub will not run them for security reasons.
